# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code done in languages I like or want to learn.

Currently:

- JavaScript/TypeScript

Each language is in its own folder with instructions on how to run.

Thanks to my good friend https://github.com/lukebro for the setup and getting me hooked on AOC!
